### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

**Start page**

![index.html](./images/start-light-house.webp)

**Account page**

![account.html](./images/account-light-house.webp)

*The SEO evaluation is incomplete because the meta description is missing and logically the user should not reach this page without first selecting the tool.*

**Schedule page**

![schedule.html](./images/schedule-light-house.webp)

*The SEO evaluation is incomplete because the meta description is missing and logically the user should not reach this page without first selecting the tool.*
